## Architecture and Technologies Used
Scroll utilizes a modern and scalable architecture that leverages the following technologies:

#### Frontend:
 The frontend of Scroll is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It incorporates GraphQL, a query language for APIs, to efficiently retrieve and update data. XState, a state management library, is employed to handle complex application states and transitions, ensuring a smooth and consistent user experience.

#### Backend:
 The backend of Scroll is powered by Node.js, a JavaScript runtime, and Express, a flexible web application framework. It utilizes GraphQL as the API layer for efficient data fetching and mutation. The integration of MongoDB Atlas, a fully-managed cloud database service, enables secure and scalable data storage.

#### Deployment:
 Scroll is deployed on Vercel, a cloud platform for static websites and serverless functions. Vercel's seamless deployment process ensures reliable and high-performance hosting for both the frontend and backend components of Scroll.
